# ZeroDivisionError in Python Function

This repository demonstrates a common error in Python: the `ZeroDivisionError`. The `bug.py` file contains a function that fails when the second argument is zero.  The `bugSolution.py` file provides a corrected version that handles this case gracefully.

## Bug
The function attempts to divide by zero, resulting in a runtime error.
